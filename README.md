# angular-google-maps-example
A quick, one page bare-bones example of an Angular-Google-Maps example application.

I found it initially difficult to get a quick example of the Angular-Google-Maps project (http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps) up and running locally so after a few unsuccessful tries, I got something to work.

This is super-basic but contains the bare minimum configuration to get the angular-google-maps API in a one-page app.
